# Secure Baseline for Enterprise-scale for AKS
This reference implementation demonstrates the recommended starting (baseline) infrastructure architecture for a general purpose AKS cluster. This implementation and document is meant to guide an interdisciplinary team or multiple distinct teams like networking, security and development through the process of getting this secure baseline infrastructure deployed and understanding the components of it. This reference implementation is based on the [AKS secure baseline](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-secure-baseline) modified for Enterprise-scale for AKS.

By the end of this, you would have deployed a secure AKS cluster, complient with Enterprise-scale for AKS guidance and best practices. We will also be deploying a workload known as the Ratings app that is also featured in the [Azure Kubernetes Services Workshop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/aks-workshop/). Check out the workshop for some intermediate level training on AKS.

For this scenario, we have various IaC technology that you can choose from depending on your preference. At this time only the Terraform version is available. Below is an architectural diagram of this scenario.

* Azure Container registry
* Azure Bastion
* Azure Monitor for containers
* Azure firewall
* MongoDB 
* Helm
* [Secret store CSI driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-driver)
* [Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/manage-azure-rbac)
* [Azure Active Directory pod-managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity)

## Steps of Implementation for AKS Construction Set

A deployment of AKS-hosted workloads typically experiences a separation of duties and lifecycle management in the area of prerequisites, the host network, the cluster infrastructure, and finally the workload itself. This reference implementation is similar. Also, be aware our primary purpose is to illustrate the topology and decisions of a baseline cluster. We feel a "step-by-step" flow will help you learn the pieces of the solution and give you insight into the relationship between them. Ultimately, lifecycle/SDLC management of your cluster and its dependencies will depend on your situation (team roles, organizational standards, etc), and will be implemented as appropriate for your needs.
