# Enterprise-scale for AKS

Enterprise-scale is an architectural approach and a reference implementation that enables effective construction and operationalization of landing zones on Azure, at scale. This approach aligns with the Azure roadmap and the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.

Enterprise-scale for AKS represents the strategic design path and target technical state for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment. This solution provides an architectural approach and reference implementation to prepare landing zone subscriptions for a scalable Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. For the architectural guidance, check out [Enterprise-scale for AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/aks/enterprise-scale-landing-zone) in Microsoft Docs.

Below is a picture of what a golden state looks like and open source software like flux and traefik integrate well within the AKS ecosystem.

The enterprise-scale for AKS is only concerned with what gets deployed in the landingzone subscription highlighted by the red box in the picture above. It is assumed that an appropriate platform foundation is already setup which may or may not be the [official ESLZ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/architecture) platform foundation. This means that policies and governance should already be in place or should be setup after this implementation and are not a part of the scope this program. The policies applied to management groups in the hierarchy above the subscription will trickle down to the Enterprise-scale for AKS landing zone subscription.

## Choosing a Deployment Model

The reference implementation is provided by three repos that all build on top of the [AKS Secure Baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/secure-baseline-aks).

1. This one
1. The [Bicep AKS Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/Aks-Construction)
1. The [CAF-Terraform-Landingzones AKS construction set](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones-starter/tree/starter/enterprise_scale/construction_sets/aks/online/aks_secure_baseline) reference implementation.

### This repo

In this repo, you get access to various customer [scenarios](./Scenarios) that can help accelerate the development and deployment of AKS clusters that conform with Enterprise-Scale for AKS best practices and guidelines. Each scenario aims to represent common customer experiences with the goal of accelerating the process of developing and deploying conforming AKS clusters using IaC as well as providing a step by step learning experience. Each scenario will eventually have a Terraform, ARM and Bicep version. They will also include GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines to help automate deployment and management of these clusters and the workload that run in them.

Use this repo is you would like step by step guidance on how to deploy secure well architected AKS clusters using our scenario based model that promotes a separation of duties, modularized IaC so you can pick and choose components you want to build with your cluster and has implementations in ARM, Terraform and Bicep. It is the best starting point for customers new to Azure or AKS.

### Bicep AKS Accelerator

A flexible templating approach using Bicep that enables multiple scenarios using a Web based tool. It provides tangible artifacts to **quickly** enable AKS deployments through CLI or in your CI/CD pipeline.

Driving the configuration experience is a [wizard](https://azure.github.io/Aks-Construction/?default=es) to guide your decision making, it provides presets for the main Enterprise-Scale deployment modes (Sandbox, Corp & Online). The output of this wizard experience are the parameters and CLI commands to immediately deploy using our maintained Bicep template to deploy your customized AKS environment in one step.
[Pipeline examples](https://github.com/Azure/Aks-Construction#devops---github-actions) are provided that show best practices for your AKS Infrastructure as Code deployments.

Use this repo if you would like to use a guided experience to rapidly create your environment with a maintained Bicep template based on the architecture of the AKS Secure Baseline.

### CAF Terraform Landingzones

A [reference implementation](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones-starter/tree/starter/enterprise_scale/construction_sets/aks/online/aks_secure_baseline) for Enterprise-Scale for AKS using CAF terraform module that abstracts away having to manually write terraform code and makes use of the Rover devcontainer.

This reference implementation is great for customers who want use an advanced well thought out model for using terraform modules and/or are familiar with CAF terraform modules or want to get familiar with it.

## Steps of Implementation for Enterprise-Scale for AKS

A deployment of AKS-hosted workloads typically experiences a separation of duties and lifecycle management in the area of prerequisites, the host network, the cluster infrastructure, and finally the workload itself. This reference implementation is similar. Also, be aware our primary purpose is to illustrate the topology and decisions of an AKS cluster. We feel a "step-by-step" flow will help you learn the pieces of the solution and give you insight into the relationship between them. Ultimately, lifecycle/SDLC management of your cluster and its dependencies will depend on your situation (team roles, organizational standards, etc), and will be implemented as appropriate for your needs.
